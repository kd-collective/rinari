Rinari Is Not A Ruby IDE.

Well, ok it kind of is. Rinari is an Emacs minor mode that is aimed
towards making Emacs into a top-notch Ruby and Rails development
environment.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This package is unmaintained these days, and
users should consider an alternative, e.g. the projectile-rails package.
